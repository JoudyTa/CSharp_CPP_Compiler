# CSharp_CPP_Compiler

Proficiently developed a C#/C++ Compiler project, showcasing expertise in programming languages and compiler design. This project involves creating a tool that translates human-readable C# or C++ code into executable machine code, encompassing lexing, parsing, semantic analysis, and code generation stages. By engineering this compiler, I demonstrated mastery in language processing, software engineering principles, and the transformation of high-level languages into functional applications.
